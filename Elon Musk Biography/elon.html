        <h3><span>Who Is Elon Musk?</span></h3>
        <p>Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which
            later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his
            late
            20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. </p>
        <p>Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial
            vehicle
            to the International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016
            and
            cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of
            President
            Donald Trump's administration.</p>
        <p>In January 2021, Musk reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the world.</p>

        <h3><span>Early Life</span></h3>
        <p>Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. As a child, Musk was so lost in his daydreams
            about inventions that his parents and doctors ordered a test to check his hearing.</p>

        <p>At about the time of his parents’ divorce, when he was 10, Musk developed an interest in computers. He
            taught
            himself how to program, and when he was 12 he sold his first software: a game he created called Blastar.
        </p>
        <p>In grade school, Musk was short, introverted and bookish. He was bullied until he was 15 and went through
            a
            growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling.</p>

    <div id="Family">
        <h3><span>Family</span></h3>
        <p>Musk’s mother, Maye Musk, is a Canadian model and the oldest woman to star in a Covergirl campaign. When
            Musk
            was growing up, she worked five jobs at one point to support her family. Musk’s father, Errol Musk, is a
            wealthy South African engineer. Musk spent his early childhood with his brother Kimbal and sister Tosca
            in
            South Africa. His parents divorced when he was 10.</p>

    <div id="education">
        <h3><span>Education</span></h3>
        <p>At age 17, in 1989, Musk moved to Canada to attend Queen’s University and avoid mandatory service in the
            South African military. Musk obtained his Canadian citizenship that year, in part because he felt it
            would
            be easier to obtain American citizenship via that path.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Musk left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated
            with
            an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics.</p>
        <p>After leaving Penn, Musk headed to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy physics.
            However, his move was timed perfectly with the Internet boom, and he dropped out of Stanford after just
            two
            days to become a part of it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995. Musk became a U.S.
            citizen in 2002.</p>

        <h3><span>Companies</span></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Zip2 Corporation
                <p>Musk launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation, in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal Musk. An
                    online
                    city guide, Zip2 was soon providing content for the new websites of both The New York Times and
                    the
                    Chicago Tribune. In 1999, a division of Compaq Computer Corporation bought Zip2 for $307 million
                    in
                    cash and $34 million in stock options.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                PayPal
                <p>In 1999, Elon and Kimbal Musk used the money from their sale of Zip2 to found X.com, an online
                    financial services/payments company. An X.com acquisition the following year led to the creation
                    of
                    PayPal as it is known today. In October 2002, Musk earned his first billion when PayPal was
                    acquired
                    by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. Before the sale, Musk owned 11 percent of PayPal stock.</p>
            </li>
            <li>SpaceX
                <p>Musk founded his third company, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, in 2002
                    with
                    the intention of building spacecraft for commercial space travel. By 2008, SpaceX was well
                    established, and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo transport for the
                    International Space Station—with plans for astronaut transport in the future—in a move to
                    replace
                    NASA’s own space shuttle missions.</p>
                <p>On May 22, 2012, Musk and SpaceX made history when the company launched its Falcon 9 rocket into
                    space with an unmanned capsule. The vehicle was sent to the International Space Station with
                    1,000
                    pounds of supplies for the astronauts stationed there, marking the first time a private company
                    had
                    sent a spacecraft to the International Space Station. Of the launch, Musk was quoted as saying,
                    "I
                    feel very lucky. ... For us, it's like winning the Super Bowl."</p>
                <p>In December 2013, a Falcon 9 successfully carried a satellite to geosynchronous transfer orbit, a
                    distance at which the satellite would lock into an orbital path that matched the Earth's
                    rotation.
                    In February 2015, SpaceX launched another Falcon 9 fitted with the Deep Space Climate
                    Observatory
                    (DSCOVR) satellite, aiming to observe the extreme emissions from the sun that affect power grids
                    and
                    communications systems on Earth.</p>
                <p>In March 2017, SpaceX saw the successful test flight and landing of a Falcon 9 rocket made from
                    reusable parts, a development that opened the door for more affordable space travel. A setback
                    came
                    in November 2017, when an explosion occurred during a test of the company's new Block 5 Merlin
                    engine. SpaceX reported that no one was hurt, and that the issue would not hamper its planned
                    rollout of a future generation of Falcon 9 rockets.</p>
                <p>The company enjoyed another milestone moment in February 2018 with the successful test launch of
                    the
                    powerful Falcon Heavy rocket. Armed with additional Falcon 9 boosters, the Falcon Heavy was
                    designed
                    to carry immense payloads into orbit and potentially serve as a vessel for deep space missions.
                    For
                    the test launch, the Falcon Heavy was given a payload of Musk's cherry-red Tesla Roadster,
                    equipped
                    with cameras to "provide some epic views" for the vehicle's planned orbit around the sun.</p>
                <p>In July 2018, Space X enjoyed the successful landing of a new Block 5 Falcon rocket, which
                    touched
                    down on a drone ship less than 9 minutes after liftoff.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Tesla Motors</li>
            <p>Musk is the co-founder, CEO and product architect at Tesla Motors, a company formed in 2003 that is
                dedicated to producing affordable, mass-market electric cars as well as battery products and solar
                roofs. Musk oversees all product development, engineering and design of the company's products.</p>

        <h3><span>Inventions and Innovations</span></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hyperloop
                <p>In August 2013, Musk released a concept for a new form of transportation called the "Hyperloop,"
                    an
                    invention that would foster commuting between major cities while severely cutting travel time.
                    Ideally resistant to weather and powered by renewable energy, the Hyperloop would propel riders
                    in
                    pods through a network of low-pressure tubes at speeds reaching more than 700 mph. Musk noted
                    that
                    the Hyperloop could take from seven to 10 years to be built and ready for use.</p>
                <p>Although he introduced the Hyperloop with claims that it would be safer than a plane or train,
                    with
                    an estimated cost of $6 billion — approximately one-tenth of the cost for the rail system
                    planned by
                    the state of California — Musk's concept has drawn skepticism. Nevertheless, the entrepreneur
                    has
                    sought to encourage the development of this idea.</p>
                <p>After he announced a competition for teams to submit their designs for a Hyperloop pod prototype,
                    the
                    first Hyperloop Pod Competition was held at the SpaceX facility in January 2017. A speed record
                    of
                    284 mph was set by a German student engineering team at competition No. 3 in 2018, with the same
                    team pushing the record to 287 mph the next year.</p>
            </li>

            <li>AI and Neuralink
                <p>Musk has pursued an interest in artificial intelligence, becoming co-chair of the nonprofit
                    OpenAI.
                    The research company launched in late 2015 with the stated mission of advancing digital
                    intelligence
                    to benefit humanity.</p>
                <p>In 2017, it was also reported that Musk was backing a venture called Neuralink, which intends to
                    create devices to be implanted in the human brain and help people merge with software. He
                    expanded
                    on the company's progress during a July 2019 discussion, revealing that its devices will consist
                    of
                    a microscopic chip that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                High-Speed Train
                <p>In late November 2017, after Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel asked for proposals to build and operate
                    a
                    high-speed rail line that would transport passengers from O'Hare Airport to downtown Chicago in
                    20
                    minutes or less, Musk tweeted that he was all-in on the competition with The Boring Company. He
                    said
                    that the concept of the Chicago loop would be different from his Hyperloop, its relatively short
                    route not requiring the need for drawing a vacuum to eliminate air friction.</p>
                <p>In summer 2018 Musk announced he would cover the estimated $1 billion needed to dig the 17-mile
                    tunnel from the airport to downtown Chicago. However, in late 2019 he tweeted that TBC would
                    focus
                    on completing the commercial tunnel in Las Vegas before turning to other projects, suggesting
                    that
                    plans for Chicago would remain in limbo for the immediate future.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Flamethrower
                <p>Musk also reportedly found a market for The Boring Company's flamethrowers. After announcing they
                    were
                    going on sale for $500 apiece in late January 2018, he claimed to have sold 10,000 of them within a
                    day.
